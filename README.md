### How to use
You need 1 rubber ducky and 1 usb for this. You can flash the rubber ducky with twin duck but it will make the proscess less afffective. We are using another usb so we can plug the rubber ducky in right after the usb pop up which will make it faster. First figure out what the letter of your usb is. If it is D and your target computer is a lenovo yoga 2 64 bit slowed down than just put the inject.bin file into your rubber ducky. If your usb's letter is diffrent, change it where the REM is telling you to change it.

Next change the delays acording to your target computer. Drag the x64 file into the root of your usb. Finnaly compile your code into a inject.bin file and enjoy taking plain text passwords in a blink of a eye.
